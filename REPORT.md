## Experiment 2 — Favorites (85-95c maker vs taker control)

**Gate status: UNDERPOWERED** — 0/300 settled maker positions — no verdict yet (this is honest, not broken)

| variant | open | unfilled | settled | wins | P&L | cond-on-fill ROI |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| kalshi maker | 27 | 0 | 0 | 0 (win-rate CI 0%-100%) | $+0.00 | n/a |
| kalshi taker | 27 | — | 0 | 0 | $+0.00 | n/a |
| poly taker (zero-fee) | 7 | — | 0 | 0 | $+0.00 | n/a |

_If maker ROI < taker ROI, queue fills are adversely selected — the exact failure mode this experiment exists to measure. The Polymarket taker leg is the zero-fee existence test of the bias itself (phase 1: taker-only there; the pre-registered gate is judged on the Kalshi maker leg only)._

## Kill criteria (pre-registered)

- **MM breadth**: at day 14, KILL unless decision >= 3x the $1.67/day 3-market baseline AND earn/pay >= 1.5.
- **Favorites**: KILL if maker conditional-on-fill ROI <= 0 once 300 positions settle (report stays UNDERPOWERED until then rather than faking a verdict).
- The Kalshi liquidity/volume incentive programs end **Sept 1, 2026** — a GO here is only actionable before renewal risk.
